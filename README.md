<div><h1>🦠 COVID Map Clone</h1></div>
<h4>Hello! This project, which visualizes the real-time COVID-19 distribution map, aimed for both data analysis and user-friendly distribution. Data visualization, API transfer, global status management, and map-based graphics provided the opportunity to take information and storage to the next level. At the same time, a robust and sustainable structure was achieved with a test-driven improvement approach.</h4>
